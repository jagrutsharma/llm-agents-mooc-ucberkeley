-----Description-----
This task requires implementing a function that checks if a string is a palindrome in Lean 4. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation.

The implementation should convert the input string to a normalized form (removing spaces, punctuation, and converting to lowercase) and then check if the normalized string equals its reverse.

-----Input-----
The input is a string:
s: A String value to check if it's a palindrome.

-----Output-----
The output is a boolean:
Returns true if the input string is a palindrome, false otherwise.
